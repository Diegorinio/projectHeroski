## Changes
    #Made barracks with Slider to "buy" units
## BUGS
    #fix water( tile, unit have decreased movement when outside water and beign in water previously, everytime movement is decreased even if unit move water->water means x/2 and in other move movement is (x/2)/2) // solved
    #fix unit remove script from unit container //solved
    #find better way to store units //solved
    #find better way to store sprites between gameObject // solved
    (idk, using prefabs for every unit etc) or just scriptable objects
    #remove resources folder?
    #change some method and script names
    #deal damage animation is playing after dealing damage and setting new turn //kidna fixed?
    #pathfinding works but not good
    #Tile activation is sometimes fucked up
    #enemyAI is not enabling sometimes
    #game state is detected only after moveement of last unit
    #unit dont move when clicked Tile in movement range but without possible path
    #tavern panel is showing collect even without launched timer
    #tavern tier changer is too fast or too slow ( random or depend on cpu)
    #Cannot exit map
    #can start level without hero selected
    #Random map generator sometimes generate spawn point which is blocking any path so unit is stuck
    #Enemy units cannot find path when blocked
    #REsources panel is rolling down when started
    #Resources panel sometimes hide over screen
    #After buying units and coming back to collect collected units are set to 0 ( value is set to slider value)
    # There is no difference between player units and enemy Units
